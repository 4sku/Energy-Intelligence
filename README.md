A Tool for Carbon and GHG Accounting Automation 


## Overview

Insights into the energy use of manufacturing processes and the emissions from electricity generation can be gained by automating carbon and greenhouse gas accounting. Using smart meters, industrial machinery, and power distribution units to monitor energy use and emissions can provide a comprehensive picture of energy usage and emissions. The information can then be used to improve sustainability.


## Automating Carbon and GHG Accounting

Do you know how much energy is used in manufacturing the products you buy? Or what greenhouse gases (GHG) and carbon dioxide (CO2) your electricity generates? Thanks to emerging technology, we can find this information quickly and easily. Here's some information on how to automate carbon and GHG accounting.


## What is Carbon and GHG Accounting?

Carbon and greenhouse gas accounting measures the energy used in manufacturing processes and the emissions from local or on-grid power sources. 


## Measuring the source of manufacture

Inductive power monitoring on industrial machinery and power distribution units can be used to automate carbon and GHG accounting. These data can be collected and analyzed to provide insight into energy use, and smart meters can also be used to record power consumption. For Scope3, data can also be collected from on-grid sources. Using this data, we can understand patterns of electricity use and estimate emissions. Once this data is collected, it can then be integrated into a system that aligns production run data with scope3 data to understand the emissions produced by electricity generation. As a result of this, manufacturing processes will have a more complete understanding of their carbon footprint. 


## Objectives 

As the manufacturing sector looks to become more sustainable, one of the challenges is understanding and measuring the energy used in manufacturing processes. In particular, many manufacturers are seeking ways to transparently measure their Scope 3 emissions - those that occur upstream and downstream of the manufacturing process.

One promising solution is web3-enabled distributed ledger technology (DLT). This technology can help create a tamper-proof record of energy use throughout the manufacturing process, from raw materials to final products. This would allow manufacturers to have a clear understanding of their energy consumption and identify opportunities for improvement. DLT could also be used to track emissions reductions over time, providing valuable data points for reporting purposes.

While web3-enabled DLT is still in its early stages of development, it holds great promise for helping manufacturers measure and manage their energy use more sustainably. As the manufacturing sector transitions to a low-carbon future, this technology will play an increasingly important role.


## Tasks

* Measure the energy used in manufacturing processes transparently

* Analyze local (solar/wind) or on-grid data sources for Green House Gases (GHG) and Carbon dioxide (CO2)

* Make Scope3 data available in tokenized data containers and digital twins

* Transfer Scope3 power data over out-of-band IoT networks


## Methods

* Monitoring of industrial machinery and power distribution units using inductive power

* Data ingest from smart meters 

* Smart PDU data is ingested through dry pairs and APIs

* Data collection from on-grid sources for Scope3

* Integration of Scope3 data from on-premises and remote renewable energy sources

* Align production run data with scope3 data by stamping job start/stop times with power usage data through the web3 dapp, web2 web portal, and web2 API.

* Integrate production data with scope3 data by stamping job start/stop times on web3 dapps, web2 web portals, web2 APIs, and operator text messages

* Data visualization and graphing for products, machines, and factories
