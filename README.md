# Energy-Intelligence
Carbon and GHG Accounting Automation

## Objectives 
* Measure the energy used in manufacturing processes transparently,
* Analyze local (solar/wind) or on-grid data sources for Green House Gases (GHG) and Carbon dioxide (CO2)
* Make Scope3 data available in tokenized data containers and digital twins
* Transfer Scope3 power data over out-of-band IoT networks

## Methods
* Monitoring of industrial machinery and power distribution units using inductive power
* Data ingest from smart meters 
* Smart PDU data is ingested through dry pairs and APIs
* Data collection from on-grid sources for Scope3
* Integration of Scope3 data from on-premises and remote renewable energy sources
* Align production run data with scope3 data by stamping job start/stop times with power usage data through the web3 dapp, web2 web portal, and web2 API.
* Integrate production data with scope3 data by stamping job start/stop times on web3 dapps, web2 web portals, web2 APIs, and operator text messages
* Data visualization and graphing for products, machines, and factories
