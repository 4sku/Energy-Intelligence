A Tool Chain for Carbon and GHG Accounting Automation 


## Overview

Insights into the energy use of manufacturing processes and the emissions from electricity generation can be gained by automating carbon and greenhouse gas accounting. For example, using smart meters, industrial machinery, and power distribution units to monitor energy use and emissions can provide a comprehensive picture of energy usage and emissions. The information can then be used to improve sustainability.


## Automating Carbon and GHG Accounting

Using emerging technology, we can quickly and easily determine how much energy is used to manufacture the products you buy or what greenhouse gases (GHG) and carbon dioxide (CO2) your electricity generates. Automating, Integrating, Distributing, and Acting on that information is, however, necessary to realize environmental and economic benefits from this data.


## What is Carbon and GHG Accounting?

Carbon and greenhouse gas accounting measures the energy used in manufacturing processes and the emissions from local or on-grid power sources. 


## Measuring the source of manufacture

Inductive power monitoring on industrial machinery and power distribution units can be used to automate carbon and GHG accounting. These data can be collected and analyzed to provide insight into energy use, and smart meters can also be used to record power consumption. For Scope3, sensors can also collect data from on-grid sources. Using this data, we can understand patterns of electricity use and estimate emissions. Once this data is collected, it can integrate into a system that aligns production run data with scope3 data to understand the emissions produced by electricity generation. As a result, manufacturing processes will have a more complete understanding of their carbon footprint. 


## Objectives 

As the manufacturing sector looks to become more sustainable, one of the challenges is understanding and measuring the energy used in manufacturing processes. In particular, many manufacturers seek ways to transparently measure their Scope 3 emissions that occur upstream and downstream of the manufacturing process.

Web3-enabled distributed ledger technology (DLT) can create a tamper-proof record of energy usage throughout the manufacturing process, from raw materials to final products. This would allow manufacturers to have a clear understanding of their energy consumption and identify opportunities for improvement. DLT could also track emissions reductions over time, providing valuable data points for reporting.

While web3-enabled DLT is still in its early stages of development, it holds great promise for helping manufacturers measure and manage their energy use more sustainably. As the manufacturing sector transitions to a low-carbon future, this technology will play an increasingly important role.


## Tasks

* Measure the energy used in manufacturing processes transparently

* Analyze local (solar/wind) or on-grid data sources for Green House Gases (GHG) and Carbon dioxide (CO2)

* Make Scope3 data available in tokenized data containers and digital twins

* Transfer Scope3 power data over out-of-band IoT networks


## Methods

* Monitoring of industrial machinery and power distribution units using inductive power

* Data ingest from smart meters 

* Smart PDU data is ingested through dry pairs and APIs

* Data collection from on-grid sources for Scope3

* Integration of Scope3 data from on-premises and remote renewable energy sources

* Align production run data with scope3 data by stamping job start/stop times with power usage data through the web3 dapp, web2 web portal, and web2 API.

* Integrate production data with scope3 data by stamping job start/stop times on web3 dapps, web2 web portals, web2 APIs, and operator text messages

* Data visualization and graphing for products, machines, and factories
